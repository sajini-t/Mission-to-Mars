# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
This ia a task to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. We'll store data in a NoSQL database called MongoDB, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask.

## Purpose:
Robin would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Resources
- HTML to identify content for web scraping.
- BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Flask to create a web application to display the data from the web scrape.
- Bootstrap


## The following extra Bootstrap 3 components were included:
- Styled the "Scrape New Data" button.
- Added the hemisphere images as thumbnails
